# Learning Models: VAK
Barbe's VAK also know as or modality theory has the core concept that a persons optimal learning style can be measured by using three distinct categories. There are visual, Aural/Auditory and Kinesthetic/Tactile.
+ __Visually-dominant__ learners best absorb information through
reading, writing and usage of graphs and charts.
+  __Aural-dominant__ learners gain the most from listening and discussing... occasionally talking to them self.
+ __Kinesthetic-dominant__ people prefer a hands on approach, learning through first hand experience.

> The VARK model consists reading and writing dominant people a different category

## Most people are a mix off these categories

A quote attributed to Confucius and incorrectly translated provided a good example of this. [source](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/226886/origin-of-i-hear-and-i-forget-i-see-and-i-remember-i-do-and-i-understand)
> I hear and I forget
> I see and I remember
> I do and I understand

Would give the impression that the writer was a mix Kinesthetic-dominant and visually-dominant.

## Assessment methods
There are a few surveys one can take or observations to be made to assess a learners capabilities

## Note
VAK and VARK are generally useful and easy to mass apply, although edge cases that effect an individuals ability to learn such as natural interests will also to engage with learning materials/activities.
