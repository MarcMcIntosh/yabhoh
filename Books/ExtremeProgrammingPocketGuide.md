The cost of low space profile is that there is not much room for in-depth discussion and details which may make the material more memorable for beginners and provide points of interest for more advance advance practitioners (if done well). On the plus side it doesn't take up much space :)

Would recommend to anyone looking for a brief overview of XP.
