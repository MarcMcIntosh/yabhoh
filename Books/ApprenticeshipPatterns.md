# Apprenticeship Patterns
<https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/apprenticeship-patterns/9780596806842/>
First thing that stands out about this book is that it is mostly written in a series of situations a person who writes software is likely to find them self dealing with using a consistent format of: context, problem, solution and action.

I read it from front to back and taking a few notes here and there by placing sticky notes on area I should come back to in the near future. I suspect that re-visiting a section when the reader finds themselves in a similar scenario that the section describes is a pragmatic to get most value out of this book, rather that attempt to remember all of the potential pitfalls and the solution to each.

One of the reoccurring concepts I had to google to find out what the writer means by the phrase was *breakable toys*, it would have been nice if to have a little description but not necessary as they are basically small inconsequential projects done to practice techniques and/or technologies. Aside from that the book assumes very little about prior knowledge and remains beginner friendly.
