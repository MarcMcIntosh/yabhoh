## Not that kind of mob
Mob programming is one group of people collaboratively working, on one machine with one person doing the typing and taking instructions from the rest of the team, frequently rotating who does the typing so every one gets a turn in the hot seat for a set amount of time or until a set amount progress on the task is made.(1)[1]

## Why?
The advantages to this approach is having multiple people working on a task collectively sharing experience and ideas with team-mates and collectively deciding the which solution or course of action / solution to use.

## Does it work
Form what I've read online, mob programming not only works but is fun, I'll update this tomorrow when I find out :)
