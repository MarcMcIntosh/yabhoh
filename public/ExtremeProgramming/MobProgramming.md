## Not that kind of mob
Mob programming is one group of people collaboratively working, on one machine with one person doing the typing and taking instructions from the rest of the team, frequently rotating who does the typing so every one gets a turn in the hot seat for a set amount of time or until a set amount progress on the task is made.(1)[1]

## Why?
The advantages to this approach is having multiple people working on a task collectively sharing experience and ideas with team-mates and collectively deciding the which solution or course of action / solution to use.

## Does it work
Form what I've read online, mob programming not only works but is fun, I'll update this tomorrow when I find out :)

## Update: 1
Today we spent one hour working through the [mars rover kata](http://kata-log.rocks/mars-rover-kata) using a mob programming style with a few additional rules applied. These rules were:
+ The addition of a commander role, who was the only person who could tell the person typing what to do.
+ Other persons who were not the driver or commander had to phrase their input as questions.

It was a small difference, but I suspect the impact was noticeable as the rules formed a barrier to engagement that other wise would have not been there. Comparatively the retro-scope afterwards did not have these rules and every one voiced an opinion. With the resulting conversations and discussions lasting as long as the kata.

Next time I would like try mob programming with out addition rules to see the results.  

## Update: 2
So this time the same kata was attempted, in a different language *scala* this time but with out the commander role.
It was a-lot more engaging and an enjoyable way to send an hour in the afternoon. :)
