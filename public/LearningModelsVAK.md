# Learning Models: VAK/VARK
Barbe's VAK also know as or modality theory has the core concept that a persons optimal learning style can be measured by using three distinct categories. There are visual, Aural/Auditory and Kinaesthetic/Tactile.

| Style | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Visually-dominant | Absorbs information through reading, writing and usage of graphs, charts and pictures |
| Aural-dominant | Gains the most from listening and discussing... occasionally talking to them self |
| Kinaesthetic-dominant | Prefer a hands on approach, learning through first hand experience |

The Neil Fleming's VARK model extends upon the VAK by considering reading and writing to be it's own separate category. [source] (https://www.verywellmind.com/vark-learning-styles-2795156)

## Mixed Modalities (MM)
Most people are a mix of learning styles. A quote attributed to Confucius and incorrectly translated provided a good example of this. [source](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/226886/origin-of-i-hear-and-i-forget-i-see-and-i-remember-i-do-and-i-understand)

> *I hear and I forget*
> *I see and I remember*
> *I do and I understand*

Would give the impression that the writer is kinaesthetic-dominant with some some capability for visual learning as-well.

## Assessment methods
There are a few surveys one can take or observations to be made to assess a learners optimal style.

### Note
VAK and VARK are generally useful and easy to mass apply, although edge cases that effect an individuals ability to learn such as natural interests will also to engage with learning materials/activities.
