# Mikado Method

In short the mikado method is a way to organise a complex series of tasks that have many interlinked co-dependencies. Similar to the game (mikado)[<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikado_(game)>] the method involves working of the tasks with least dependencies until the task is complete.

Most resources I've found talk about using this method in a large code base, [1](https://manning-content.s3.amazonaws.com/download/3/558b9be-92a7-4ebf-90ba-c7fdd830aea7/MikadoMethod_CH01.pdf), [2](http://www.methodsandtools.com/archive/mikado.php), [3](http://mikadomethod.info/). Although I was recently shown this method can also be applied to other activities in-order to make life easier :)

Here's my understanding of the process write drawn goals / large tasks using a check list.  like so,
+ [ ] Task 1
+ [ ] Task 2
Then write the requirements and / or sub task for each
+ [ ] Task 1
  + [ ] requirement 1.1
  + [ ] task 1.1
+ [ ] Task 2
  + [ ] requirement 2.1
  + [ ] task 2.1
Then do the same for the new tasks / requirements. Eventually thus will form a tree like structure and with the end points or (leafs) and cross over points becoming more obvious. Then similar to the game, the idea is to pick of the leaf nodes until a sub-task is complete then work your way in.

It's a novel approach to organising complex event/task/system, I recon the main benefit when using the mikado method this way is writing the requirements for each task to be complete and break those down into smaller more manageable chunks.
