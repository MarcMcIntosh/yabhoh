*Scrum: a framework to support teams in complex product development. Scrum consists of Scrum Teams and their associated roles, events, artefacts, and rules, as defined in the Scrum GuideTM.* -- [scrum glossary](https://www.scrum.org/scrum-glossary)

Most of this page will be datelining the above in order to understand more about scrum mostly by paraphrasing the [guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2017/2017-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf),

Scrum is practised in many industries as a framework for managing developing products by suing the knowledge gained from experience and observations (aka [empiricism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/empiricism)) to optimize predictability and control risk during the process of development (process control) by utilising an iterative (repeating) and incremental approach, similar to [Kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen) management theory. Both of which focus on transparency, inspection, and adaptation in-order to continually improve and produce value.


### What's the point?
Synthesising workflows, the advantage scrum has over one of it's counter parts like [scientific management theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_management]) of scrum is that it allows teams to adapt rapidly to changing demands/designs and restrictions (hence the name agile?).
