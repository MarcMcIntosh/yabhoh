*Scrum: a framework to support teams in complex product development. Scrum consists of Scrum Teams and their associated roles, events, artefacts, and rules, as defined in the Scrum GuideTM.* -- [scrum glossary](https://www.scrum.org/scrum-glossary)

Most of this page will be datelining the above in order to understand more about scrum mostly by paraphrasing the [guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2017/2017-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf),

Scrum is practised in many industries as a framework for managing developing products by suing the knowledge gained from experience and observations (aka [empiricism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/empiricism)) to optimize predictability and control risk during the process of development (process control) by utilising an iterative (repeating) and incremental approach, similar to [Kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen) management theory. Both of which focus on transparency, inspection, and adaptation in-order to continually improve and produce value.


### What's the point?
Synthesising workflows, the advantage scrum has over one of it's counter parts like [scientific management theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_management]) of scrum is that it allows teams to adapt rapidly to changing demands/designs and restrictions (hence the name agile?).

## Scrum Values

In the srum guide there are [five core values of scrum](https://scrumorg-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/drupal/2018-05/ScrumValues-Tabloid.pdf) these are:

+ __Courage__ Scrum team members have courage to do the right hing and work on tough problems.
+ __Focus__ Everyone focuses on the work of the sprint and goals of the scrum team.
+ __Commitment__ People personally commit to achieving the goals of the scrum team.
+ __Respect__ Scrum team members respect each other to be capable, independent people.
+ __Openness__ The scrum team and it's shareholders agree to be open about all the work and the challenges with performing the work.

Which are could be confused with the values stated in the [agile manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/)
+ __Individuals and interactions__ over processes and tools.
+ __Working software__ over comprehensive documentation.
+ __Customer collaboration__ over contract negotiation.
+ __Responding to change__ over following a plan.

From a software developer point of view that later makes more sense as it's domain specific, although I would have to state good documentation helps understand how something works (or is intended to work) and how to it supposed to be used.

## Roles

The value from the guide consistently mention the scrum team, a team is made up of <!-- how many --> distinct roles
