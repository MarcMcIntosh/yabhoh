# KISS: Keep It Simple, Stupid

Keeping things simple, really simple... as simple as possible, as more the more complicated something becomes the chances of it not working increase [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle#In_software_development), and as some of the work I did earlier to day will eventually have to be replaced by a more elegant solution that took less time to type.

## How?
A couple of approaches to try and remember.
+ [Minimalism](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism_(computing)>) Try not to think to far ahead, do just enough and add more expand if/as needed.
+ [YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it): You aren't going to need it, [Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them](https://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/practices/pracnotneed/)

## Did it work?
The above was written yesterday towards the end of the working dat, today was spent fixing and refactoring parts of a project to be more simplistic, and do just enough to meet the minium requirements. By the end of the day (now) more functionality has been added to the project, more than the previous days combined if including re-writes of the core functionality. Much of this is down to thinking about the end user, and using "user stories" to track progress, then breaking those down in to smaller tasks and finally approaching each based on a "the one with the least dependencies as possible".
