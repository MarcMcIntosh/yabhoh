## Resources
The resources directory contains more directories that work as categories which contain even more directories that work as topics that a resource is about.
Ideally the README.md in each folder should describe the name and subject matter while additional markdown files information about a book, video, link, program relating to the directory it is in.

## Configuration and automation
Improvements are welcome :)
