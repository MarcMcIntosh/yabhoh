# KISS: Keep It Simple, Stupid

Keeping things simple, really simple... as simple as possible, as more the more complicated something becomes the chances of it not working increase [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle#In_software_development), and as some of the work I did earlier to day will eventually have to be replaced by a more elegant solution that took less time to type.

## How?
A couple of approaches to try and remember.
+ [Minimalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism_(computing)) Try not to think to far ahead, do just enough and add more expand if/as needed.
+ [YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it): You aren't going to need it, [Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them](https://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/practices/pracnotneed/)
